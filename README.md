## <sub> How to install.

* Install the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads).
* Install the OpenAI [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/openai).
* Install [pexpect](https://pypi.org/project/pexpect) to control the Oregon Trail process. 
* Clone the repo.
* Oregon Trail can be installed in a number of ways and it depends on your system.
  * The original [BASIC source](https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1978-05/page/n143/mode/2up) was made public in 1978 and implementations of that can be found online ([example1](https://github.com/fortran-gaming/oregon-trail-1975), [example2](https://github.com/topherPedersen/OregonTrail1978)).
  * I found it easy to use [this Python 3 implementation](https://github.com/philjonas/oregon-trail-1978-python) of the code. Just install (download) the repo onto your system and then edit the config accordingly.
  * It is important that the version you choose runs in the terminal without any graphical interface. ChatGPT needs to be able to read the program's output after all.

## <sub> How to use.

* Add your OpenAI API key to <b>config.ini</b>.
* Ensure Oregon Trail command in <b>config.ini</b> is correct or update it for your specific install.
  * If Installed with the Python link from above it will work with the default (Just ensure the path is correct for your install location).
* python3 chatgpt_plays_ot.py
  * Run default application.
* python3 chatgpt_plays_ot.py -h
  * Display help message.
* python3 chatgpt_plays_ot.py -m "gpt-4"
  * Use model "gpt-4".
* python3 chatgpt_plays_ot.py -U
  * UNLEASHED mode. This lets ChatGPT play without user interaction until OT process terminates.
